## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/THEORY.md` — theory documentation: each categorical construction
  (schemas, instances/functors, path equations, findings taxonomy,
  migration, rule lens), what it buys, where validated, reading order
  (Johnson → Spivak → AlgebraicJulia), glossary.
- README: project overview, deliverables manifest, docs map, roadmap,
  tooling guide.
- Rule lens (P8, `catherine-nq5`): rules as subobjects + resolution
  policy; kata-6 boundary reframed as a triviality-floor claim;
  pre-registered two-kata validation.
- Bogart pilot corpus (P9, `catherine-hc6`): openspec prose invariants →
  executed findings; genesis-vibes adopted for CLI plumbing (P3).

### Added (initial baseline)

- ddl-managed tooling baseline: lefthook gates (pre-commit: `ah check`,
  pretender gate, `spk lint`; pre-push: `ah check`), beads no-db tracked
  export, wai workspace, espectacular (`ah`) config, openspec skeleton.
- whisper/turu knowledge workspace (repo-scope tracked; `.whisper/private/`
  gitignored — machine-local, never pushed).
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — CT modeling workbench design (Rule-of-5 converged),
  vendored methodology reference in `docs/ref/`.
- Beads tickets `catherine-bpz..alr` — phases P0–P7 with dependency chain;
  P6 is the project stop condition.
